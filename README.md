# MyVoice
### AI based Video Call Platform for Speech and Hearing Impaired
# 

## Project Idea:

Language barriers are very much still a real thing.
We can take baby steps to help close that. Speech to text and translators have made it a heap easier. But what about for those that maybe don't speak or can't hear?
What about them?
So, we came up with an idea of-My Voice.
My Voice is a video calling and chat platform which helps to overcome the language barriers between the people.
Video conferencing should be accessible to everyone, including users who communicate using sign language.
The pandemic has made video conferencing apps an integral aspect of everyday life. With work from home policies on the rise and remote social events becoming the go-to solution for social distancing, the technology is becoming part of everyone's new normal.
So My Voice will help in this situation of pandemic and connect deaf and mute people to larger extent.

## Project Description:

My Voice - Is an Al based Video calling and chat platform for people communicating with sign language or want to communicate with others who cannot understand sign language.  This application will connect speech-impaired and hearing-impaired persons to the normal video conferencing app so that they can communicate easily with others in sign language.  In this Project the sign language will be understand by the system in real-time and show results with good accuracy on the screen instantly making it an efficient way to communicate without any lag.  My Voice contains all the features of a normal video conferencing and chat application along with the special features for the users to communicate with sign languages.
